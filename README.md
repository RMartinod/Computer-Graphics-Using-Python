# Computer Graphics Using Python: Quick Step-by-Step fundamentals for CAD/CAM/CAE

#As the title indicates, this book is a quick step-by-step introduction of computer graphics using Python, 
#including rigid and non-rigid transformations; BÃ©zier, spline and Catmull-Rom curves and surfaces: and printing in 3D (additive manufacturing). 
#It is a short book designed not to overwhelm the reader.

#By the end of the book, the reader will have acquired knowledge of fundamental elements in computer graphics, 
#which they can then apply in more advanced projects, allowing them to gain new knowledge more easily.
